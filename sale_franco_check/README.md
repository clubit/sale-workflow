# Franco Check for Partner #
############################

This module provides a possibility to do a franco check when confirming
quotations. A franco check consists of the following two elements:

* Franco Amount defined on the partner.
* Franco Check on a quotation

When confirming a group of quotations via the wizard, a franco check is
performed. This checks that the total of the quotations for a certain
partner is equal or larger than the franco amount defined on that partner.
Only when this is the case, the quotations are confirmed for that partner.
